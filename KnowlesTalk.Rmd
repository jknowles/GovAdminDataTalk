## Introduction

- Why does causality matter for policy making?
- Why do we like experiments?
- Why do we hate experiments?
- Turning a weakness into a strength
- What does policy analysis look like in the real world?


## Causality Matters

![correlation does not equal causation](assets/PiratesVsTemp.png)

## But it's not everything

- Decisions have to be made with best evidence available
- 

## Experiments, Yay!

## Experiments, Boo!

## John Conway's Game of Life

> - Simple rules in large systems create emergent properties that are complex 
and unpredictable
> - A simple example is John Conway's Game of Life, played on a two-dimensional 
grid
> - Any live cell with fewer than two neighbors dies
> - Any live cell with two or three neighbors lives
> - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies
> - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell
> - These simple patterns result in emergent patterns that stabilize in 
unpredictable but orderly ways

# The game.of.life() function ------------------

  # distributed individuals

## Policy is Not Unlike This

- Start with simple rules
- Add more simple rules
- Regulated entities react to these rules
- Observe emergent properties
- Repeat

## Quasi-Experiment Examples in the Wild

- Regression discontinuity through ELL reclassification
- Fixed effects regression through BLBC program offer
- Propensity score matching for pre-college scholarship programs
- Differences in differences evaluation of community learning centers (CLCs)


## Why? Linked Administrative Systems

## Why? Big Data
